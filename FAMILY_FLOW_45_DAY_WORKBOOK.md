# Family Flow: 45-Day Connection Workbook
## Offline Family Wellness Journey

---

### **About This Workbook**

Family Flow is a 45-day guided journey to help your family build lasting connection habits that work offline. This workbook contains the exact same methodology used in our digital app, but designed for families who prefer pen-and-paper connection over screen-based interaction.

**The Goal**: After 45 days, your family will have developed independent connection rituals that don't require any app, tool, or digital device.

**Philosophy**: This is a "graduation workbook" - success is measured by your family no longer needing it. We're teaching you to fish, not giving you fish.

- Family members stop sharing feelings or appreciation
- Screen time becomes a source of frequent conflict
- You want to teach these practices to extended family
